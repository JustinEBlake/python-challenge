## PyBank Instructions

Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

  1. The total number of months included in the dataset
  1. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  1. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  1. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  1. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyBank Location

  - main.py file can be found ---> python-challenge/PyBank/main.py
  - analysis text file can be found ---> python-challenge/PyBank/Analysis/pybank_analysis.txt
  - raw csv file can be found ---> python-challenge/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv

## PyBank Source Code

  - Most of source code was learnt through curriculum, along with previous experience of python prior to bootcamp.
  - I did have trouble with the arithmetic logic behind calculating the changes in PL and finding the average. I had a tutor session with Limei    Hou and she was very helpful in explaing the logic, as well as helping to simplyify my code. (Prior to the tutor session I had multiple different for loops for each calculation, however she suggested using one for loop to extract all the values needed.)

## PyPoll Instructions

Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

  1. The total number of votes cast
  1. A complete list of candidates who received votes
  1. The percentage of votes each candidate won
  1. The total number of votes each candidate won
  1. The winner of the election based on popular vote
